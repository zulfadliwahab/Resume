                As a senior engineering leader with 19 years of experience, I specialize in driving operational excellence and technological innovation within high-tech manufacturing environments, including the medical device and data storage industries. Currently pursuing an MBA to complement my technical background, I am passionate about bridging the gap between complex engineering solutions and strategic business objectives.
            </p>
            <p class="indent-8">
                Throughout my career, I've progressed from a hands-on engineer to leading and developing large, multidisciplinary teams of up to 38 members, including managers, engineers, and technicians. My leadership philosophy is centered on building organizational capability and fostering a culture of continuous improvement to meet both current and future manufacturing needs.
            </p>
            <p class="indent-8">
                My core technical expertise lies in the end-to-end lifecycle of factory automation. This includes designing and commissioning fully automated assembly and inspection lines, as well as establishing robust sustaining and maintenance strategies to maximize equipment uptime and reliability. I have a proven track record in leading projects involving PLC & HMI programming, SCADA/MES integration, custom vision systems, and the implementation of Factory Control Systems (FCS) to ensure 100% part traceability and WIP control.
            </p>
            <p class="indent-8">
                My current MBA studies are sharpening my skills in managing large-scale investment projects, financial oversight, and aligning departmental strategy with global business goals. I am always keen to connect with professionals to discuss challenges and opportunities in manufacturing technology, operational strategy, and leadership.
